### An Introduction to JavaScript

- Javascript was initally created to "make web pages alive"
- "LiveScript"
- ECMAScript

### How to Run JavaScript Code?

- script.js as its default name
- console.log("Hello, Javascript!") sample of printing/display text in JS

### Variables
- Used to store information
- Example: An online shop ==> the information might include goods being sold online with the different functions (e.g. add to cart, profile, payment method)
- Way back we often use "var" to declare a variable but now there is new way to do it and its called "let"

## Naming Variables
- Variables name is unique
- Variables name much easier to read if we follow the Camel casing method
- JavaScript Reserved Words (check here ==> https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp) don't use it as variables 
- "const" we use it if the data was constant (e.g. birthdate)
- when using "const" its a good practice to name it Uppercase (e.g. MY-BIRTHDATE)

- let ==> is a modern variable declaration
- var ==> is an old-way to declare a variable
- const ==> is it used if the data was constant

### Limitations when naming variables in JavaScript

1. The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and \_
2. The first character must not be a digit

### Numbers

- The building blocks of programming logic

// asignmment (=)
// equality (==)
// strict equality (===)
